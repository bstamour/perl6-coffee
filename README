The purpose of this script is to help you make better tasting
coffee. Simply run it from your command line with the number of 6oz
servings you wish to make, and (optionally) specifying your coffee
brand and strength. The default (and so far only) brand supported is
Maxwell House. The default strength is "strong", but other options are
"weak" and "normal." Strength merely instructs the program to round
the number of tablespoons of grounds up (if strong) or down (if weak)
or do no rounding (normal).

The plan is to eventually add more coffee brands to this script in due
time (i.e., whenever I switch coffee brands, or whenever someone sends
me a pull request :-)). The script is written in Perl 6, so you will
need a Perl 6 interpreter installed to run it.

Example invocation:

./coffee --strength=weak 12   # A full pot of weak coffee
9 tbsp
